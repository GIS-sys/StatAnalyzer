1) Change config.py (or delete it if you want manual input). Settings are:
- first line: path to your file.csv
- second and further lines: list of columns you want to ignore for some reason (for example if they are not categorical)

2) Run main.py

3) all correlated and uncorrelated pairs will be placed in data/ folder
